1) Based on the reports of your fellow classmates during our last class (2020-09-09), please briefly summarize any new ideas for apps to 
solve people’s problems that you have come up with as a result of listening to other students.

  A student brought up a grocery mapping app. I thought this was a good idea and could be done by using crowdsourcing like Waze. 
  Where people work together to improve the accuracy.

2) Several people mentioned the “conflict” between the desire to have a free app, and developers’ desire (and need) to get compensated.
Can you suggest any ways by which developers can reap their creativity and efforts’ rewards without alienating their “customer base '' 
by inundating with ads and/or charging them.

  This is a tough conflict. I believe it would depend on the services that the app is providing for.
  I think the method that Teamviewer uses is best. For regular consumer use make it free, for commercial use make it paid (of course with more capabilities).


3) Please point to any app/software/website that offers in your opinion an excellent UI/UX. Briefly explain in what ways you find its UI/UX to be so good.

  The app Webtoon has good UI/UX. Everything is easily accessible and welcoming. Easy to maneuver through the different tabs to find what you are looking for.


4) Have last class’s discussions and/or items #1-3 gotten you closer toward a mobile app you would like to pursue as a project for this course? Please discuss briefly.

  The potential idea of a crowdsourcing app seems to be an interesting app. If people are working together there's no need to 
  roam in the stores for what you want. It would definitely help people who have never been to a specific store and would 
  stop them from spending hours finding what they need.
