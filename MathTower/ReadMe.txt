I look to stop the repetitiveness of math. I am going to make an app that helps young children learn math in a fun interactive way. The name of the app will be Math Tower. They will be solving math problems that will be disguised as different puzzles. These puzzles will consist of switches, buttons, sliders and other types of interactive methods to keep the student active. After solving each problem they will continue to climb the tower until they reach the top. The app will be simple yet entertaining to keep the child engaged. This app will be set up to be on a smart phone or tablet. Many of my young family members and students I teach have their own tablet that they were given to play with.
